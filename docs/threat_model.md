# Threat Model

The platform focuses on local detection plus analyst workflows for the following attack vectors:

1. **Impersonation** - Deepfakes targeting executives, celebrities, or high-value employees.
2. **Social Engineering** - Tailored media to phish, pretext, or coerce staff.
3. **KYC Bypass** - Spoofed biometrics (voice/face) to defeat onboarding controls.
4. **Evidence Fabrication** - False artifacts inserted into investigations or litigation.
5. **Reputation Damage** - Viral misinformation campaigns to erode trust.
6. **Blackmail** - Synthetic compromising material used for extortion.
7. **Misinformation** - Rapid propagation of fake media to sway public opinion.

These definitions power the `/threats` API so the desktop UI and backend reasoning stay in sync.
