# ML Research Workspace

This directory holds experimentation assets for EfficientNetV2-based deepfake detection.

- `notebooks/efficientnetv2_training.ipynb`: Prototype notebook for dataset ingestion, transfer learning, and evaluation. TODO markers highlight where to add code.
- `models/` (within `backend/`) stores exported checkpoints once training completes.

> NOTE: These assets are not required to run the desktop demo. They enable future local-only experimentation.
